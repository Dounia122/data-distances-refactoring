# Refactoring

In this challenge we'll practice refactoring code, and test writing.

We'll be switching a lot between `.py` files, your notebook, and the terminal.

So let's use VS Code like a pro.

Open everything in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

For this challenge, do everything inside VS Code.

A couple of tips:

- When you run the first cell of a notebook in VS Code, you'll have to select the kernel at the top of the screen.
   - First choose "Select Python Environment".
   - Then search for "lewagon" and choose it.


- To open a terminal, go in the `Terminal` menu and choose `New Terminal`.

Run all the terminal commands (git, pytest, make, ...) from the terminal, not from your notebook.
